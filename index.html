                <p>Greetings!  I'm Kiri.  I live in Rochester, NY where I attended Nazareth College, receiving a BA in Mathematics and Childhood-Middle Childhood Education.  I then completed my Master's Degree in Inclusive Education at Nazareth College in 2012.  I moved to Alexandria, VA where I began teaching middle school math as a special education teacher at Prince William County Schools.  I obtained a second Master's degree in Educational Leadership and was able to apply my new skillset as the Special Education Department Chairperson, IEP Administrator, and member of the school's Leadership Team.  After 6 years of teacher leadership in Virginia, I moved back to Rochester and worked as the Special Education Middle School Director at a local charter school. After 9 years of teaching, I decided to pursue a new career direction and began my new career at Par-Tech, Inc. as a Software Developer.  I am currently enrolled in UC Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp Extension and will be adding to this portfolio as I create more web applications.</p>
